# Fire Emblem AI: Project EmblemMind

> Monte Carlo-inspired tactical AI for Fire Emblem 6/7/8 using emulator memory analysis and simulated planning.

---

## Project Goal

**EmblemMind** is an AI framework designed to play Fire Emblem GBA titles (6, 7, or 8) via emulator automation and game state simulation. The goal is to build a turn-based AI agent that plans out intelligent moves using:
- Heuristic scoring
- Lightweight Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-like planning
- Game state extraction from memory
- Emulator-controlled decision execution

This project is a **1-month challenge** to create a functional and interesting AI agent that can reasonably beat early maps or assist a human player with high-quality move suggestions.

## Supported Games

| Game Title        | Code Name  | Region | Notes |
|-------------------|------------|--------|-------|
| Fire Emblem 6     | FE6        | JP     | Fan translation required |
| Fire Emblem 7     | FE7        | NA     | "Blazing Sword" |
| Fire Emblem 8     | FE8        | NA     | "Sacred Stones" |

## AI Design Summary

The AI reads the current game state from an emulator's memory, simulates possible actions for the player’s units, and selects the best move using a lightweight planning method inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search.

### Key Features:
- **Memory Extraction**: Uses memory reading (or Lua scripting) to extract map and unit data.
- **Game Logic Model**: Internal simulator to predict outcomes (attacks, movement, etc.).
- **AI Engine**:
  - **Heuristic Scoring** for evaluating unit actions.
  - **Shallow Tree Planning** to simulate multi-turn outcomes.
- **Input Automation**: Emulates keypresses to control units.
